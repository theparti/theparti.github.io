Discovering the improbably-looking hoodoos, they learned about their mutual love of exploration, curiosity, and the wilderness.

But, they did not have the luxury to go on many more dates because Parke was moving to Phoenix in just a few days.
Murti had just ended a relationship and while she didn't feel emotionally available, she thought Parke was special.
Even if it meant they would be "just friends," she needed to pursue a friendship with him.

<p>
He sent selfies of his journey across the Rockies, she learned how to take a proper selfie, and they decided to see where things would go.
