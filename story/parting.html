<p>
They indeed did see each other around.
</p>

<p>
They flew a Cessna-182 to Bryce Canyon and Murti was excited to make more friends who were backpacking and could lend her gear.
Discovering the improbably-looking hoodoos, they learned about their mutual love of exploration, curiosity, and the wilderness.
After going on fun hikes together, working on Parke's old Land Cruiser, they spent a weekend in a mountain cabin throwing caber, splitting wood, deadhanging, and eating delicious chili with mutual friends.
</p>

<p>
A magical Tuesday night at a Boulder arcade was enough to prompt their first kiss.
But, they did not have the luxury to go on many more dates because Parke was moving to Phoenix in just a few days.
Murti had just ended a relationship and while she didn't feel emotionally available, she thought Parke was special.
Even if it meant they would be "just friends," she needed to pursue a friendship with him.
</p>

<p>
He sent selfies of his journey across the Rockies, she learned how to take a proper selfie, and they decided to see where things would go.

							<h2>An Uncertain Start</h2>
                <h3>
                They made a point to "see each other around."
							</h3>

                <p>
								They hiked Boulder's many trails, wrenched on Parke's aging Land Cruiser, and, with a pilot-friend, flew a small plane to Bryce Canyon to go backpacking.
								Through these experiences they came to recognize their mutual love of exploration, curiosity, and the wilderness.
								Despite this connection, Murti was in a relationship and Parke preparing to move to Arizona, so they carefully stayed well within the boundaries of friendship.
								When Parke was just a few weeks from his departure, Murti joined the goodbye party he threw at a cabin in the mountains.
								With friends, they spent a raucous weekend splitting firewood, tossing cabers, throwing hatchets, building fires, eating chili, and drinking from the "camel-keg."
								After everyone else left the next day, Parke and Murti stayed behind.
								For hours they lingered and talked in the quiet cabin, savoring what they expected to be the last of their time together.

								<h3>But everything suddenly changed</h3>
								<p>
								one magical Tuesday night, when Parke decided to draw out the goodbye just a little more.
								When they met at a Boulder arcade, Murti revealed that she was newly single.
								With only a few days until his departure, Parke knew it was now or never, and they finally kissed.
								Was this just a rebound?
								Only time could tell.
								</p>

								<p>
								They both felt the other was someone worth investing in, and they agreed to make a long-distance effort.
								Perhaps it would lead to a lifelong friend.
								Perhaps something different.
								As Parke journeyed across the rockies to a new life in Arizona, they kept up a dialogue, and began teaching themselves the art of the selfie.
