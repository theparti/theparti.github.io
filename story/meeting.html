								<h2>How We Met</h2>
								<p>Parke was getting his PhD and Murti was an undergraduate research assistant at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at CU Boulder.
                                    Parke worked in the "stars" section of the building and Murti worked in the "plasma" section.
                                    They co-existed in parallel until one fortunate day, when Murti encountered a man in the kitchen.
                                    He was about to rinse a french press when she introduced herself.
                                    She asked, "are you that guy who wears the eyepatch?"
                                    Parke had just relinguished an eye patch he had been sporting publicly for the last year to train an amblyopic eye into astronaut-eligible acuity. 
                                    With a charming chuckle, he responded, "Yep, that's me!"
                                 </p>

                                 <p>Mutually intrigued, they parted ways and agreed to see each other around.</p>
