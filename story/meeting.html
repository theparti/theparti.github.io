						<h2>First Meeting</h2>
						<h3>Parke and Murti were graduate and undergraduate students</h3>
						<p>
						working at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at CU Boulder when they met in 2017.
            They co-existed in parallel on opposite sides of LASP's second floor until, one fortunate day, they met in the middle.
						Murti encountered Parke in the kitchen rinsing a dish.
						Ever the personable coworker, Murti immediately introduced herself.

						<h3>Murti asked,</h3>
						<p>
						 "are you that guy who wears the eyepatch?"
            The question had merit.
						Parke had just relinquished an eye patch he had been shamelessly wearing for the last year in a bid to train an amblyopic eye into astronaut-eligible acuity.
            With a charming chuckle, he responded, "Yep, that's me!"
						Mutually intrigued, they parted ways. "See you around!"
