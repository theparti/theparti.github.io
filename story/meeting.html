Parke was getting his PhD and Murti was an undergraduate research assistant at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at CU Boulder.
Parke worked in the "stars" section of the building and Murti worked in the "space physics" section.
They co-existed in parallel until one fortunate day, when Murti saw a man in the kitchen.
He was about to rinse a french press when she introduced herself.
After he introduced himself, she prompted, "are you that guy who wears the eyepatch?"
Charmingly chuckling, he responded, "Yep, that's me!"

After learning a bit more about what the other person worked on, they parted ways and agreed to see each other around.
