<p> They spent a fantastic week romping around Maui, exploring the local beaches and disprate landscapes in Haleakala National Park. Their day and a half on Lana'i island was equally cool! Murti tried snorkeling and was afraid she might drown since she didn't know how to tread water. Parke tried natto (fermented soybeans) and was afraid his taste buds wouldn't recover.
Parke showcased his impressive ability to grow a thick, full beard.

Surrounded by Haleakala's alien landscape, they talked about marriage. They discussed that such an adventure would not be something either of them would take for granted. If the time came and the moment felt right, then they should each propose to the other, they agreed.
