Those weekend adventures were great solutions to a long distance connection because they had the chance to connect in the wild.
They climbed and hiked in the desert, and snowshoed and cross-country skied in Colorado.
One unfortunate trip left Murti with an injured knee, a mile down the Grand Canyon.
Parke valiantly helped carried her up part way and supported her as she carried herself up the rest of the way.
This was the first of several moments where they needed to rely on each other to ensure their safety as a team.
Murti knew Parke was even-keeled, but was struck by just how calm he remained in the face of perceived danger.
She is grateful to experience his calmness on a daily basis, especially in stressful moments.

They enjoyed each other's company so much that when Parke offered Murti a mileage ticket to Madagascar, she immediately accepted.
It was Murti's first trip overseas (aside from her home country, Guyana) and she appreciated the country's beauty, its people, and its biodiversity.
They spent a few weeks spending time with Tara's family, learning about the important work Pivot is doing in the Ifanadiana district, and exploring the nearby forests. They tried delicious fruits, some of which were completely new to them (photo above of a "savanna fruit").
