<p> Fleeing Nashville to be with Parke during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Murti landed in Arizona with two bags and no idea of how they should weather the pandemic together.
She suggested the ask to borrow a camper trailer offered to them the previous summer from a friend.
Their friend agreed to lend them the Rambling Gypsy Rose, enabling a year and a half of climbing and living in the American Southwest.

Moving in together is an important milestone for most couples. For Parke and Murti, it was life changing. They set up the Rambling Gypsy Rose in places that offered both adequate network reception and immense solitude. Like most people isolating themselves to prevent the spread of COVID-19, they relied mostly on each other for human interaction. Through this experience, they learned that bananas are delicious, they work exceptionally well as a team, and that living in the wilderness was a lifestyle that suited them both.
