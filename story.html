						<h3>Parke and Murti were graduate and undergraduate students</h3>
						<p>
						working at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at CU Boulder when they met in 2017.
            They co-existed in parallel on opposite sides of LASP's second floor until, one fortunate day, they met in the middle.
						Murti encountered Parke in the kitchen rinsing a dish.
						Ever the personable coworker, Murti immediately introduced herself.

						<h3>Murti asked, "are you that guy who wears the eye patch?"</h3>
						<p>
            The question had merit.
						Parke had just relinquished an eye patch he had been shamelessly wearing for the last year in a bid to train an amblyopic eye into astronaut-eligible acuity.
            With a charming chuckle, he responded, "Yep, that's me!"
						Mutually intrigued, they parted ways. "See you around!"

						<h3>
						They made a point to "see each other around."
					</h3>

						<p>
						They hiked Boulder's many trails, wrenched on Parke's aging Land Cruiser, and, with a pilot-friend, flew a small plane to Bryce Canyon to go backpacking.
						Through these experiences they came to recognize their mutual love of exploration, curiosity, and the wilderness.
						Despite this connection, Murti was in a relationship and Parke was preparing to move to Arizona, so they carefully stayed well within the boundaries of friendship.

					<h3>At a cabin in the  mountains</h3>
					<p>
						Parke threw a last hurrah to say goodbye to Colorado, and Murti joined the fray.
						With friends, they spent a raucous weekend splitting firewood, tossing cabers, throwing hatchets, building fires, eating chili, and drinking from the "camel-keg."
						When everyone else left on Sunday, Parke and Murti lingered.
						They sat and talked for hours, savoring the peaceful scenery and what they expected to be the last of their time together.

					<h3>But everything suddenly changed</h3>
					<p>
					one magical Tuesday night, when Parke decided to draw out the goodbye just a little more.
					When they met at a Boulder arcade, Murti revealed that she was newly single.
					It was now or never, and they finally kissed.
					Was this just a rebound?
					Only time would tell.
					</p>

					<p>
					They both felt the other was someone worth investing in, and they agreed to make a long-distance effort.
					Perhaps it would lead to a lifelong friend.
					Perhaps something different.
					As Parke journeyed across the rockies to a new life in Arizona, he sent a steady stream of photos, and they began teaching themselves the art of the selfie.

					<h3>Parke moved fast</h3>
					<p>
						to keep what had begun from fizzling.
						He invited Murti to Arizona to backpack in Joshua Tree National Park during his second weekend in the state.
						The heat was oppressive and the oatmeal bland, but it was just the thing.
						That trip kicked off a regular exchange of weekend visits, and the relationship grew easily.
						It seemed almost too good to be true.

					<h3>Only it was true.</h3>

						They connected under blue skies.

						They backpacked in the Superstition Mountains.
						They hiked to a snowy mountain hut.
						And, in the summer of 2018, they spent a month in Madagascar.
						Every trip brought them closer.

					<h3>Things shifted when an emergency struck</h3>
					<p>
						on a trek in the Grand Canyon.
						Descending below the rim, Murti slipped and gashed her knee on a rock.
						The wound was remarkably deep, and as Murti's body went into shock she told Parke she could see the colors fading from the scenery around her.
						Murti's safety lay in their mutual response.
						They bandaged the knee as best they could and, once Murti had rested, began a slow and (for Murti) agonizing climb out.
						Many hours later, in the dead of night, they gained the rim and drove to Flagstaff to have the wound stitched.
						Both Murti and Parke were left feeling new appreciation for the other, grateful to have as a partner someone who responds with equanimity to crisis.

					<h3>Murti was Nashville bound</h3>
					<p>
						less than a year into their relationship to begin a Masters bridge program in physics at Vanderbilt and Fisk Universities, turning long distance into longer distance.
						This increased the cost of each visit five fold, rendering frequent weekend trips unsustainable.
						Parke knew that the relationship was worth a major sacrifice, so he prepared to move to Nashville, even if it meant leaving his job in Arizona.
						Thankfully, his advisor graciously allowed him to work remotely half time.
						By the end of the year, his monthly flights had earned him a highly-coveted elite status on the luxurious Frontier airlines.

					<h3>It was like a medium move in.</h3>
					<p>
						Parke and Murti now spent about half their time living together, but each still paid their own rent and maintained a space entirely their own.
						The rhythm of life in the East was comfortable, if not as adventurous as the West.
						Murti lived with the Quinns, a family with two young children and an extra room in their vibrant house.
						Kentucky, Parke's home state, was next door.
						Parke and Murti spent their free time hanging out on the family Tree Farm in Kentucky (including running its yearly 10K), seeing some of Parke's old friends, and exploring the excellent rock climbing the southeast has to offer.

					<h2>A Brush with Marriage</h2>

					<h3>With some expiring airline miles to burn,</h3>
					<p>
						Parke and Murti set off to romp around Maui in 2019.
						The trip is memorable not just because of Parke's extravagant beard, the gratuitous servings of shave ice, Murti's fear of drowning when snorkeling, or Parke's fear of irreparable taste bud damage after tasting natto (fermented soybeans): it is memorable because of a particular conversation had one beautiful morning alone in a cabin in the crater of Haleakala.
						The topic of conversation was marriage.
						It was clear it had crossed both of their minds.
						But they kept the conversation vague.
						They agreed that marriage might be something interesting to pursue, in a general sort of way... assuming one was interested in such things, of course.
						Really, why all the hubbub though?
						After all, what purpose does marriage, as an institution, really serve anyhow?
						Well, good thing they settled that.

					<h3>When the pandemic hit</h3>
					<p>
						in 2020, Murti landed in Phoenix with two bags and a half-baked plan to literally flee into the hills.
						Parke picked her up at the airport and from there they drove straight out of town to the friend who had generously agreed to lend them his 12' camper trailer.
						The plan was to take the camper, christened the Rambling Gypsy Rose, and hide with it in a range of mountains by Tombstone.
						Both were filled with trepidation.
						With little warning, they would be truly sharing a space for the first time -- and little space at that, under 100 square feet of it, with no running water and few modern comforts.

					<h3>To their immense delight,</h3>
					<p>
						the off-grid lifestyle suited Murti and Parke to a tee.
						Cellular internet, solar power, and biweekly visits to town for mail, water, and groceries, provided all that was needed for life and academic work.
						Free time was more abundant than ever before, and they spent it delving into deep conversations, cooking sour banana pancakes, and scrambling around on the nearby cliffs.
						With the nurturing influence of the outdoors and a person near at hand to love and to count on, they had all they could ever really want.

					<h3>When Murti was accepted to Berkeley for a PhD</h3>
					<p>
						they were both thrilled and uncertain.
						It was a boon for Murti's career, but it meant giving up the tranquil life they loved for the hustle and bustle of a metropolis.
						To soften the blow, Parke requested annual summer retreats to Alaska, taking effect immediately.
						Accordingly, they spent the summer of 2021 trekking across tundra, eating piles of blueberries, failing to summit anything worth noting, and falling in love with Alaska.

						Most importantly, Murti is seizing the opportunity to kick her career into gear, while Parke clings to her coattails.
